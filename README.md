## Alice in alternate orthography

I converted &ldquo;la alis. cizra je cinri zukte vi le
selmacygu'e&rdquo; (the Lojban translation of &ldquo;Alice In
Wonderland&rdquo;) to a non-standard orthography. The result is
available in plain text format encoded in UTF-8. The goal of this
alternate orthography is to provide a visually lightweight
representation of Lojban text, making it more readable and more
pleasing to the eye. It differs from standard orthography in two ways:

**Apostrophe.** The orthography completely eliminates
the apostrophe ('), which is replaced by a diaeresis only where this
is required to distinguish a vowel pair from a diphthong. The
diaeresis is placed on the letters &lsquo;i&rsquo; and
&lsquo;u&rsquo;, which are the only ones used to form diphthongs.

More precisely,

> *a diaeresis is applied to the second vowel of a two-syllable vowel
> pair if the pair would otherwise constitute a falling diphthong
> (&ldquo;aï, eï, oï, aü&rdquo;), and to the first vowel if the pair
> would otherwise constitute a rising diphtong (&ldquo;ïa, ïe, ïi, ïo,
> ïu, ïy, üa, üe, üi, üo, üu, üy&rdquo;); the diaeresis is not used in
> any other case.*

**Period.** An alternate period &lsquo;&middot;&rsquo;
(middle dot, U+00B7) is consistently applied before the sentence link
&ldquo;.i&rdquo; and its compounds, except at the beginning of
paragraphs. This is done as a visual aid to the reader, to mark the
beginning of sentences. This alternate period is also applied in
conjunction with &ldquo;la'o gy &middot; &hellip; &middot;
gy&rdquo;. Otherwise, the period (which is optional according to the
[Reference
Grammar](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=195)) is omitted, as in large parts of the original
version.
